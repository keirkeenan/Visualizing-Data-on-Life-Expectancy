# Keir's Visualizing Data on Life Expectancy
**Below is information on life expectancy in the United States from 1900-2017. You will also find information on how the United States compared to other countries' life expectancy in 2017.**

## Graph 1: Average Life Expectancy in the US (1900-2017)

This graph of U.S. mortality trends since 1900 highlights the differences in age-adjusted death rates and life expectancy at birth. Between 1900-2017, the US reached a low of 37 years-old in 1918 and a high of 76 years-old from 2007 through 2017.

Life expectancy is the key metric for assessing population health. Broader than the narrow metric of the infant and child mortality, which focus solely at mortality at a young age, life expectancy captures the mortality along the entire life course. It tells us the average age of death in a population. This graph allows us to compare the life expectancy of three countries, namely the United States, China, and Russia.
